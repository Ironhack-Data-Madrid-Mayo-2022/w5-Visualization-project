![portada](https://boostlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10-types-of-data-visualization-1.jpg)


## Overview

The goal of this project is to put what you've learnt until now together in a single project.

In this project you should use the **`publications database`**. 

In previous labs, we asked you to extract some information from it using `sql querys`. This time you should build a visualization that answers this questions.

As a future data analyst, you should be able to also ask the proper questions so add at least one new question and answer it in the visualization.

Remember that should tell a story with your dashboard and be able to present ir to us!!

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you've got!

**Heeyyy!!!** *If you prefer to use your own data and ask your own questions feel free to do so!!*

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* A dasboard or presentation with a story display in several pages.
* You should also include a README.md file that describes the steps you took and your thought process as you built your data pipeline.


## Super Ultra Mega Blaster Tips

* **Examine the data**.

* **Break the project down into different steps** - A hundred simple tasks are` better than a single complicated one

* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of intermediate Python as well as some of the things you've learned in the bootcamp. This is a great way to start tying everything you've learned together!

* **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! 

* Think about adding relevant figures to your project each day, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.

* **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version. Name your commits well.

* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want. GIYF.

* **Have fun! Never give up! Be proud of your work!**
